Email Training
Please join the water cooler at the beginning of your shift and remain there for your entire training shift. The Support Advisor will join you to assist with any questions you have.  

Today you are working on emails. Use this time to build your skills and ask lots of questions of your colleagues. This is a great opportunity to understand the workflow intricacies and gain valuable troubleshooting skills in a low-pressure environment. Feel free to ask questions and engage with the supervisors and consultants during your email time. Have a great email shift!
