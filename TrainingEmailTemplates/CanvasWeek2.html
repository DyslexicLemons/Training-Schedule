    Please join the water cooler at the beginning of your shift and remain there for your entire training shift. The Support Advisor will join you to assist with any questions you have. 
    Continue working on the Support Center Frontline Consultant Canvas course Week 2. You should have completed the Support Center Operations and Training content first before starting this course.  
    Once you have completed Week #, Stop. Reach out to the On Point Training Supervisor for next steps. 
    Note:  If you are taking SC training remotely (off-campus), you will first need to connect to the Ivanti SSL VPN to access all functionality for the course. In addition, please note that you must be logged in to the Knowledge Base (KB) before you can access any KB documents. 
    The Frontline Consultant training is designed to introduce you to the various systems and services available at IU and the processes our team uses to support our clients. You are NOT expected to memorize everything here! The various Knowledge Base links and quizzes are designed to get trainees comfortable with using their general knowledge of a topic to answer basic questions and to find the answers using available resources for more advanced issues. 
    If you have any questions about any of the material in the training course, or about the Support Center in general, you may want to look at the New Consultant FAQ. Direct any additional questions to the On Point Training Supervisor listed in this Training Plan.
