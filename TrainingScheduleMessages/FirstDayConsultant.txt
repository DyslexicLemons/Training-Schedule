New Consultant First Day Email 

__________________________________________________________________________________ 

Welcome to the Support Center! Do not delete this email! You will refer to it often during your first few days. On your first day a Support Center supervisor will review this email with you. 

Your First task is to complete any Canvas courses or documents emailed to you by IU Human Resources. It is critically important you complete any items sent to you from HR. 

 

Support Advisors: 

The Support Advisor is the supervisor currently on duty who organizes staff and answers operational questions from consultants. There is a Support Advisor available 24 hours a day and during business hours, there are two. Any time you have a question or need help you should reach out to the Support Advisor on duty.  

To find who is Support Advisor, open the schedule in pie https://scfl.pie.iu.edu/Authentication?previousUrl=%2FShiftsOverview (Bookmark this!). Scroll Down to the correct day, then look at either “Support Advisor” or “Support Advisor In Office.”  

Once you find the Support Advisor for the current day and time, use teams to send a direct message to the Support Advisor. You can enter their username into the Teams search bar to find each person. Schedule changes happen, but you will always be able to reach the Support Advisor.  Below is the current supervisor list. If you are from IU Indianapolis, reach out to the IU Indianapolis Support Advisor first. If you are from Bloomington, reach out to the Bloomington Support Advisor first. This helps spread the questions across both Support Advisors working evenly.

Communication: We use Microsoft Teams for most Support Center communication. As a member of the Support Center Frontline, you are a member of the IU-SC-All Team. This team is comprised of different channels, the first channel we want to introduce you to is the Water Cooler. We use this channel to work together virtually or just hang out. While you are in training, we ask that you come into this channel at the beginning of your shift, by doing so it makes it easy for others to come into the water cooler to introduce themselves and check in to see how you are doing. It also makes it very easy if you have a question or need help, we will know where to find you! If you don’t see anyone in there, just wait, someone will join in soon. Water Cooler 

 

Mentor: You will be assigned a mentor when you move from your training schedule into your regular staffing schedule. Until then all Supervisors will be your mentor and will help you in any way needed. Once your mentor is assigned you will have regular monthly meetings. These mentor meetings let us communicate progress and areas of improvement. There is an area in Teams for you to track your meetings where you both can add items to discuss and a document to track praises and learning opportunities. Please bookmark the links below! 

MM – Mentor Meetings – Link the consultants MM File  

You and your mentor update this file with topics to discuss in your next mentor meeting. You can add topics to this document whenever you think of something you would like to talk about, your mentor will do the same. 

MT – Mentee Tracking – Link the consultants MT file  

When you get praise or if there is an opportunity for improvement, a supervisor or member of quality and assurance (QAT) will add notes to this document. It is available for you to view.
