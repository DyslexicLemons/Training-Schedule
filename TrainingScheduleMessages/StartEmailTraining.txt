Start Email Training: 

Congratulations! You are ready to work on emails for the Support Center Frontline. 

You and your trainer will begin with shadowing. Start by watching the trainer do one or two emails. Once you understand the basics, switch roles! You will do the emails and the trainer will watch to verify that everything is correct, professional, and helpful! 

For every email you and your trainer work on together, document the ticket number in the Canvas quiz.
